# Make a flashcard database with a command line tool for practicing
# A flashcard should be an object with attributes: front, back, notes/details
# the details or notes attribute would be additional explanation for the back.
# This allows testing from front to back, back to front.
# Testing from back to front can allow a fair test without showing all the details and giving away the answer
# Testing from front to back can reveal either the back and/or the details
# the script should take an argument to specify a study deck, this study deck will be contained in a file
# consider whether we need a unique identifier or sequence number for each card
# decks should have functions to add cards, delete cards, shuffle cards, alphabetize them
